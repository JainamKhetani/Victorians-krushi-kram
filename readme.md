## 🌟 Overview

**DayFlow** is a web-based **Human Resource Management System (HRMS)** developed to simplify and automate everyday HR activities within an organization.

The system is designed for:
- Small to mid-scale organizations  
- Academic & hackathon projects  
- HR workflow demonstrations  

Instead of relying on spreadsheets, paper records, or email approvals, DayFlow offers a **centralized, structured, and secure digital platform**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In many organizations, HR processes suffer due to outdated or manual systems. Common issues include:

- ❌ Attendance recorded manually or inconsistently

## 🧪 Security & Validation

Security is a core design principle of **DayFlow HRMS**. Since the system handles sensitive employee information such as personal details, attendance records, leave history, and payroll data, strong security mechanisms are implemented at every level of the application.

### 🔐 Session-Based Authentication
DayFlow uses **PHP session-based authentication** to manage user login and identity throughout the application lifecycle.

- User sessions are created upon successful login
- Sessions store user identifiers and role information
- Sessions are destroyed explicitly during logout
- Prevents unauthorized access to protected pages

This approach ensures:
- Secure persistence of login state
- Protection against session hijacking through controlled session handling
- Lightweight authentication without external dependencies

---

### 🛂 Role-Level Access Control

- 👤 User Login  
        ↓  
- 🧾 Role Identified  
        ↓  
- 🧑‍💼 Admin / HR  
  ├─ Manage Employees  
  ├─ Approve / Reject Leave  
  └─ View Attendance & Payroll  

- 👤 Employee  
  ├─ View Personal Profile  
  ├─ View Attendance  
  └─ View Salary  

        ↓  
- 🔎 Role Validation Checks  
  ├─ On Page Load  
  ├─ Before Sensitive Actions  
  └─ Before Admin-Only Modules  

        ↓  
- 🛡️ Access Granted or Denied  

---

### 🚫 Protected Admin Routes
All administrative routes are secured using server-side validation.

- Admin dashboard pages are inaccessible without valid admin session
- Unauthorized access attempts are redirected to the login page
- Direct URL access is blocked for restricted pages

Example protections include:
- Admin dashboards
- Payroll management pages
- Employee management modules

This ensures that sensitive operations remain accessible only to authorized personnel.

---

### 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization
All user-provided inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

Security measures include:
- Trimming and validating form inputs
- Sanitizing text fields using PHP built-in functions
- Escaping output using `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS attacks
- Validating numeric and date inputs before database operations

These practices significantly reduce risks related to:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- SQL Injection
- Malicious form submissions

---

### 🔁 Secure Redirect Handling

- 👤 User Request  
        ↓  
- 🔐 Session Check  
        ↓  
- ❌ Unauthorized?  
  ├─ Yes → 🔑 Login Page  
  └─ No  
        ↓  
- ✅ Authorized Access  
        ↓  
- 🖥️ Protected View Rendered
  

| Redirect Rule | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Session Validation | 🔐 Active |
| Unauthorized Redirect | 🔑 Enabled |
| Loop Prevention | ♻️ Controlled |
| UX Safety | ⭐ Optimized |



---

### 🧠 Summary of Security Practices
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protected admin-only routes
- Input validation & sanitization
- Secure redirect mechanisms

These combined measures make DayFlow a **secure and reliable HRMS platform** suitable for real-world usage.

---

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

DayFlow HRMS is designed with **future scalability and extensibility** in mind. Although currently implemented for academic and hackathon use, the architecture supports growth into a full-fledged enterprise HR system.

---
